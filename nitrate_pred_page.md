## Predicting Total Nitrate (NO3) in the Atmosphere

#### Date: 10/23/20

**Project overview:** This hackathon was hosted by the Data Science Go (DSGO) conference. Our team was provided time-series environmental data from the EPA on national parks in California. The goal was to garner insights into total nitrate levels.

Our group explored common environmental pollutants to find possible links between them and the total nitrate in the atmosphere. Among the pollutants, we found that ammonium and sulfate were associated with the strongest positive correlation to nitrate levels. Our project was awarded "Best Insights" for our in-depth exploratory data analysis and crisp presentation.

**Improvements:** Given more time, we would have looked into measuring and improving our model accuracy, along with any other algorithms. Ideally, we would also search for factors that correlate with nitrate levels which we can control (ex. number of park visitors).

***Technical skills:*** Correlation, t-test, Gamma regression
